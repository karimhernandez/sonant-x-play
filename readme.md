# Sonant-X-Play

A tiny and fast player for sonant-x songs.

I wanted something for casual browsing and listening of various sonant-x compositions. Sonant-X-Live is brilliant for creating and editing, but when browsing lots of different songs it becomes quite cumbersome. This player attempts to address this.

For more details on sonant-x, see [sonant-x](https://github.com/nicolas-van/sonant-x) and [sonant-x-live](https://github.com/nicolas-van/sonant-x-live).
